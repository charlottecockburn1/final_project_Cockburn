The Future of Energy Consumption for Heating and Cooling

In this project, I use climate model data to estimate future energy consumption for space heating and air conditioning for 32 countries. These countires represent over 65% of global population.

Analysis 

1. Plotting change in GDP, population, and heating/cooling degree days for each country
2. Clustering countries based on their current energy usage
3. Method 1: Creating a uniform "score" for potential future contribution (i.e., normalizing changes in variables)
4. Method 2: Multiple regression between GDP, population, heating/cooling degree days, and heat/air conditioner energy use
5. Method 3: Simple regression between heating/cooling degree days and heat/air conditioner energy use
